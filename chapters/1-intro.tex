Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using LiDAR technology stands as a cornerstone in autonomous navigation systems, enabling real-time mapping and localization essential for the robust and safe operation of various autonomous platforms. However, difficulties arise in mapping environments that contain specular or transparent surfaces as laser rays' reflections and transmissions on these areas lead to inaccuracies in the generated map, posing potential hazards during navigation. Recent research has introduced several novel techniques aimed at addressing this issue, but these approaches often exhibit constraints: some rely on incident angles closely aligned to normal; others are limited by specialized material handling, lacking adaptability across diverse surfaces; certain algorithms struggle with real-time processing, impeding their practical application.
